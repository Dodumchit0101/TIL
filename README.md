# TIL

Yay the first post on my Git:)
Although I couldn't post my progress on Python for the first month of this course, but I guess it is always ok to catch up...?

I started my AI course on Jan 04, 2021 and since the python course was over just yesterday, I started learning SQL from today WOW
(By the way this is the first time learning things about coding and I'm SUFFERING)

I will try to post everyday about what I have learned that day and I will try to do so in English(so I can practice writing in English AND study coding at the same time)

What I'm thinking right now is that I'll create two branches: python and SQL(and if I learn more languages they will be added too) and try to organized what I have learned, and additionally for python I will be posting my progress on solving algorithmic problems

I'm not sure how am I supposed to do things right but yes, trying matters

Wish me luck!
