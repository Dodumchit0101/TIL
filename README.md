# TIL

Yay the first post on my Git:)
Although I couldn't post my progress on Python for the first month of this course I guess it is always ok to catch up...?

I started my AI course on Jan 04, 2021 and since the python course was over just yesterday, I started learning SQL from today WOW
(By the way this is the first time learning things about coding and I'm SUFFERING)

I will try to post everyday about what I have learned that day and I will try to do so in English(so I can practice writing in English AND study coding at the same time)

Wish me luck!
